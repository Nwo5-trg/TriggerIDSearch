# Trigger Group Search
Select all triggers that trigger a specific group(s).

The menu is in the find group id menu (magnifying glass in delete menu).

Bottom button is select by group, middle button is select by item id, top is collision id.

To input multiple groups just seperate by ",".

Toggle button toggles between selecting triggers that target group or objects with the group. (this does not support itemids and collision ids sry :3)
